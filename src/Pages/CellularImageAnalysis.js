            <h3> Bioimage Informatics </h3>
            <p>
                Bioimage Informatics is a subfield of bioinformatics and computational biology. It focuses on the use of computational techniques to analyze bioimages, especially cellular and molecular images, at large scale and high throughput. The goal is to obtain useful knowledge out of complicated and heterogeneous image and related metadata.

                Automated microscopes are able to collect large numbers of images with minimal intervention. This has led to a data explosion, which absolutely requires automatic processing. Additionally, and surprisingly, for several of these tasks, there is evidence that automated systems can perform better than humans. In addition, automated systems are unbiased, unlike human based analysis whose evaluation may (even unconsciously) be influenced by the desired outcome.

                There has been an increasing focus on developing novel image processing, computer vision, machine learning, statistics, data mining, database and visualization techniques to extract, compare, search and manage the biological knowledge in these data-intensive problems.

                For over three centuries, light microscopy has served as a powerful and indispensable tool for making important biological discoveries. The entry of digital imaging into microscopy has given rise to a new branch of bioinformatics research, also known as Bio-Imaging Informatics. Irrespective of the type of detection device, whether it is the human eye, a camera or an electronic scanner, the human brain still remains the major interpretation engine of image data. However, technological advances in instrumentation, such as 3-dimensional time-lapse imaging and high-throughput screening platforms, have led to experiments that routinely produce thousands of images containing billions of pixels. It is obvious that the manual processing and analysis of images traditionally performed by human experts is increasingly becoming inefficient, incomplete and imprecise.
