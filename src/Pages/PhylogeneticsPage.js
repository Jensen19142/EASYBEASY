            <h3> Phylogenetics </h3>
            <p> Phylogenetics is the scientific study of the evolutionary relationships and history among organisms, genes, or proteins. It aims to reconstruct the evolutionary tree of life, illustrating how different species or molecular sequences are related to one another and tracing their common ancestry.</p>
            <p> Consider building a "family tree"/evolutionary tree of the COVID-19 virus </p>
            <p> 
- Created a website as a visualization platform called Lineage Tree to explore SARS-CoV-2 Pango Lineage Networks and Lineage-Defining mutations.
- Responsible for making an automatic pipeline that generates data for the website every day.
- Utilized e-charts react templates for the website
- Used next.js framework to create the pages and API </p>
            <p>
             A phylogenetic tree, also known as an evolutionary tree, is a graphical representation of the evolutionary relationships between biological sequences. In bioinformatics, phylogenetic trees are created using molecular data like DNA or protein sequences to understand evolutionary history.
