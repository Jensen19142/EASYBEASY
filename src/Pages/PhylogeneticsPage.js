                Phylogenetics is the scientific study of the evolutionary relationships and history among organisms, genes, or proteins. It aims to reconstruct the evolutionary tree of life, illustrating how different species or molecular sequences are related to one another and tracing their common ancestry.

                A phylogenetic tree, also known as an evolutionary tree, is a graphical representation of the evolutionary relationships between biological sequences. In bioinformatics, phylogenetic trees are created using molecular data like DNA or protein sequences to understand evolutionary history.
